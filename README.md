‚úÖ **Interactive Map Integration**: Uses Leaflet with your provided geocoding API key
‚úÖ **Forward & Reverse Geocoding**: Convert addresses to coordinates and vice versa
‚úÖ **Map Click Selection**: Click anywhere on the map to select coordinates for new locations
‚úÖ **Search Functionality**: Search and locate existing places on the map
‚úÖ **Visual Markers**: Different colored markers for each location type
‚úÖ **Data Persistence**: All data saved to browser's local storage
‚úÖ **Import/Export**: Backup and restore your location data
‚úÖ **Statistics Dashboard**: View counts of each location type

## Getting Started

The system is now ready to use! You can:

1. **Preview the application** in the App Viewer to test all features
2. **Click the publish button** to deploy it online
3. **Share the link** with others

## Technology Stack

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
- Leaflet (for maps)
- React-Leaflet

All shadcn/ui components have been downloaded under `@/components/ui`.

## File Structure

- `index.html` - HTML entry point
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration file
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration file
- `package.json` - NPM dependencies and scripts
- `src/app.tsx` - Root component of the project
- `src/main.tsx` - Project entry point
- `src/index.css` - Existing CSS configuration
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Main dashboard with location management
- `src/components/LocationTree.tsx` - Hierarchical tree view component
- `src/components/LocationForm.tsx` - Add/edit location form component
- `src/components/MapView.tsx` - Interactive map component
- `src/lib/geocoding.ts` - Geocoding API integration
- `src/lib/locationStore.ts` - Local storage management
- `src/types/location.ts` - TypeScript type definitions

## Components

- All shadcn/ui components are pre-downloaded and available at `@/components/ui`
- Custom components for location management and mapping

## Styling

- Add global styles to `src/index.css` or create new CSS files as needed
- Use Tailwind classes for styling components

## Development

- Import components from `@/components/ui` in your React components
- Customize the UI by modifying the Tailwind configuration

## Note

- The `@/` path alias points to the `src/` directory
- In your typescript code, don't re-export types that you're already importing
